Hi people!

My name is Hafiz Badrie Lubis and I always describe my self as a passionate software engineer, [Incubus](http://www.incubushq.com){:target="_blank"} and [Chelsea FC](http://www.chelseafc.com){:target="_blank"} big fan,
and a blessed man with a loving wife and cheerful daughter.

I'm working at [KMKLabs](https://www.kmklabs.com){:target="_blank"} as Head of Data Engineer. We're working on to make our data infrastructure better, provide all accesses of all our data to the people in the company,
and build some interesting products with machine learning.

I've been moving around to look on the suitable platforms for me to write and I, finally, find jekyll is the perfect tool for me. So, I'm going to start all over again and write everything that I find interesting to share.
If you're keen to know more about past articles that I wrote, you can go to [my wordpress page](https://hafizbadrie.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"}. But, I assure you that it will not be updated anymore.

Have a nice day!
