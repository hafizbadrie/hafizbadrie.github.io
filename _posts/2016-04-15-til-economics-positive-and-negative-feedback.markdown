One of the book that I read is [*The Signal and The Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail--but Some Don't*](http://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail--but/dp/0143125087/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460770488&sr=8-1&keywords=signal+and+noise){:target='_blank'}.
New terminologies that I learned while reading the book are **Negative Feedback** and **Positive Feedback**.

**Negative Feedback** is a condition when you raise your price tag and you get lower sales in return, and vice versa.
While, **Positive Feedback** is a condition when you raise your price tag and the sales number is increasing, as well.
