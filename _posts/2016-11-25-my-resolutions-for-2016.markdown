At first, I'm quite sceptical about resolutions. I got through years without having resolutions,
since I thought it didn't work for me. Why? It's because I'm really bad at being a consistent person.
To have a 1 year long self goal doesn't really make sense for me. But not this year, year 2016.

I wanted a change in me, it was **to be a better learner**. So I decided to have some resolutions.
I realised that so many resolutions will leave me with nothing but no results, so I started small with 2 resolutions.

### 1. Read 5 books

To be honest, I really hated reading books. I knew I had to learn, but I was just so lazy to do that (oh dear, what an idiot).
So, I started to read more, either it was book, blog post, newspaper, etc. It was good, I was getting better for a lot of things.
Then, I wanted that attitude to present in me at all time, and to have reading target every year sounded a good idea. So, this year I hoped I could read 5 books.

Now I've read those 7 books and it will make next year's target will be 7 books.
By the way, from those books, my 3 favorites are **Mindset: The New Psychology of Success**, **The Manager: Inside the Minds of Football's Leaders**,
and **Naked Statistics**.

### 2. Getting better at machine learning

This one is related to what I'm doing in the office. Machine learning is one of our responsibilites.
To be honest, I don't have any experience on this area, that's why I mainly contributed on the engineering part,
like the ETL(s), data streams, and infrastructures.

However, it's still very important for me to know this matter as I need to have a clear view of where we're going with machine learning.
So, I decided to get better in machine learning as one of my resolutions. And that's also the reason why I read **Predictive Analytics**.

I'm happy to see where I am now with machine learning. I know the basics and I know how create apps for certain needs.
We also have a session where team members can learn together about this. I'm getting better, we're getting better, and that's the fun part.

I wonder if next year I can also take a role as a data scientist.

To have resolutions really don't hurt at all. It's good if you want to make some changes in your life.
Looking at what I've done with resolutions, my suggestions are:

1. Know what kind of person you want to be in the next 1 year.  
2. Make plans and break it down into some small pieces of plans.  
3. Find measureable plans, so that it's easy for you to review it by the end of the year.  
4. Start small, don't have too many resolutions, be realistic.
